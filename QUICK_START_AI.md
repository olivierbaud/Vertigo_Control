## âœ… Status: Complete and Ready!

Your AI integration passed all tests (8/8)! Here's how to use it.

---

## 1. Verify Everything Works

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm run test:ai
```

Expected output: `ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed! (8/8)`

---

## 2. Start the Application

### Backend:
```bash
npm start
```

### Frontend (in separate terminal):
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

---

## 3. Use the AI Chat

1. **Open the frontend**: http://localhost:5173
2. **Log in** (or register if needed)
3. **Create or select a project**
4. **Select a controller** (or create one)
5. **Add some devices and controls** (the AI needs these to reference)
6. **Click the "AI Chat" tab** ðŸ¤–

---

## 4. Try Your First Prompt

Example prompts:

```
Create a main page with a volume slider for Main Audio
```

```
Add buttons to trigger Meeting Start and Meeting End scenes
```

```
Create a settings page with all device controls
```

```
Make a simple control panel with volume, mute, and source selection

## 5. Provider Selection

**Gemini (Recommended for testing)**
- Free tier available (15 requests/minute)
- Fast responses
- Good quality
- Default selection

**Claude (Recommended for production)**
- Best quality results
- More expensive ($3-$15 per 1M tokens)
- Excellent understanding of complex requests

**OpenAI GPT-4**
- Great quality
- Most expensive ($10-$30 per 1M tokens)
- Well-established

---

## 6. What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. **Context gathering**: System collects all your devices, controls, and scenes
2. **AI generation**: Selected provider generates GUI files based on your prompt
3. **Validation**: Generated files are checked for correctness
4. **Draft storage**: Valid files saved to `gui_files` table with `state='draft'`
5. **Display**: You see modified files, explanation, and usage stats

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

**"No API key available"**
â†’ Check `.env` has at least one AI provider key

**"Controller not found"**
â†’ Make sure you're viewing a valid controller with devices

**"Validation failed"**
â†’ Add some devices and controls first

**Dark mode not working**
â†’ Component fully supports dark mode via Tailwind

### For Testing:
- Use Gemini (free tier)
- Try different prompts
- Iterate on existing drafts

### For Production:
- Add Claude API key for best quality
- Consider BYOK for enterprise customers
- Monitor usage stats in database
- Implement rate limiting if needed
